# Tennis Refactoring Kata in C#

For main description, see [top level README](../README.md).

## Code Reading Practice
Test your code reading skills. 

* Get a notebook and write the names of any [code smells](https://sammancoaching.org/reference/code_smells/index.html) you want to practice spotting as headings.
* Open all the urls in a browser in different tabs (see below). 
* Start your stopwatch. 
* Look at each tab in turn and scroll through the code. 
* Name any code smells you notice and note down on your notebook which variant number had that smell. 
* Stop the timer when you've looked at all the code. 

Compare notes with others who have done the same exercise - did you find the smells in the same places? Was anyone faster and more accurate than most? Why do you think that is? Discuss how to get better at code reading.

### Opening the code quickly and consistently using a browser
There are browser plugins that will open a list of urls in different tabs, search for "Open Multiple URLs" in your brower's extensions or add-ons marketplace. Or you could write a little script to do it.

Here is a list of github urls of all the TennisGame C# classes:
